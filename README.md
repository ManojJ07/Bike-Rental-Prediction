The objective of this project is
To build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the demand for bike rentals based on various factors such as time of day, weather conditions, holidays, and other relevant factors.
The steps that will be followed to carry out this project are as follows:

1.	Data Collection:
Collect the data from various sources such as bike-sharing companies, weather stations, and other relevant sources. [Already Provided]
2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Perform data cleaning and preparation tasks such as
- Imputing missing values
- handling outliers
- transforming data to make it suitable for analysis.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data with visualization like scatter plots and bar plots.
- Finding the correlation between the features and how they influence the other features.
- Also identify patterns and relationships and select relevant features.
4.	Feature Engineering:
Select features from the existing ones that may help in improving the predictive power of the model.
5.	Model Building:
Build machine learning models using various algorithms such as
- linear regression
- decision trees
- random forest
- neural networks.
6.	Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as
- mean squared error (MSE)
- mean absolute error (MAE)
- R-squared.
7.	Model Tuning:
Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters to improve its performance.
8.	Deployment:
Deploy the model to production and monitor its performance over time.
